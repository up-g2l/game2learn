\begin{itemize}

\item[A1]
Define a \textit{growing spiral} in the plane to be a sequence of points with integer coordinates $P_0 = (0,0), P_1, \dots, P_n$ such that $n \geq 2$ and:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The directed line segments $P_0 P_1, P_1 P_2, \dots, P_{n-1} P_n$ are in the successive coordinate directions east (for $P_0 P_1$), north, west, south, east, etc.
\item
The lengths of these line segments are positive and strictly increasing.
\end{itemize}
[Picture omitted.]
How many of the points $(x,y)$ with integer coordinates $0\leq x\leq 2011, 0\leq y\leq 2011$ \emph{cannot} be the last point, $P_n$ of any growing spiral?

\item[A2]
Let $a_1,a_2,\dots$ and $b_1,b_2,\dots$ be sequences of positive real numbers such that $a_1 = b_1 = 1$ and $b_n = b_{n-1} a_n - 2$ for $n=2,3,\dots$. Assume that the sequence $(b_j)$ is bounded. Prove that 
\[
S = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{a_1...a_n}
\]
converges, and evaluate $S$.

\item[A3]
Find a real number $c$ and a positive number $L$ for which
\[
\lim_{r\to\infty} \frac{r^c \int_0^{\pi/2} x^r \sin x \,dx}{\int_0^{\pi/2} x^r \cos x \,dx} = L.
\]

\item[A4]
For which positive integers $n$ is there an $n \times n$ matrix with integer entries such that every dot product of a row with itself is even, while every dot product of two different rows is odd?

\item[A5]
Let $F : \RR^2 \to \RR$ and $g : \RR \to \RR$ be twice continuously differentiable functions with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $F(u,u) = 0$ for every $u \in \RR$;
\item for every $x \in \RR$, $g(x) > 0$ and $x^2 g(x) \leq 1$;
\item for every $(u,v) \in \RR^2$, the vector $\nabla F(u,v)$ is either $\mathbf{0}$ or parallel to the vector $\langle g(u), -g(v) \rangle$.
\end{itemize}
Prove that there exists a constant $C$ such that for every $n\geq 2$ and any $x_1,\dots,x_{n+1} \in \RR$, we have
\[
\min_{i \neq j} |F(x_i,x_j)| \leq \frac{C}{n}.
\]

\item[A6]
Let $G$ be an abelian group with $n$ elements, and let 
\[
\{g_1=e,g_2,\dots,g_k\} \subsetneqq G
\]
be a (not necessarily minimal) set of distinct generators of $G$. A special die, which randomly selects one of the elements $g_1,g_2,...,g_k$ with equal probability, is rolled $m$ times and the selected elements are multiplied to produce an element $g \in G$. 
Prove that there exists a real number $b \in (0,1)$ such that
\[
\lim_{m\to\infty} \frac{1}{b^{2m}} \sum_{x\in G} \left(\mathrm{Prob}(g=x) - \frac{1}{n}\right)^2
\]
is positive and finite. 

\item[B1]
Let $h$ and $k$ be positive integers. Prove that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there are positive integers $m$
and $n$ such that
\[
\epsilon < |h \sqrt{m} - k \sqrt{n}| < 2\epsilon.
\]

\item[B2]
Let $S$ be the set of all ordered triples $(p,q,r)$ of prime numbers for which at least one rational number $x$
satisfies $px^2 + qx + r =0$. Which primes appear in seven or more elements of $S$?

\item[B3]
Let $f$ and $g$ be (real-valued) functions 
defined on an open interval containing $0$, with $g$ nonzero and continuous at $0$.
If $fg$ and $f/g$ are differentiable at $0$, must $f$ be differentiable at 0?
 
\item[B4]
In a tournament, 2011 players meet 2011 times to play a multiplayer game. Every game is played by all 2011 players
together and ends with each of the players either winning or losing. The standings are kept in two 
$2011 \times 2011$ matrices, $T = (T_{hk})$ and $W = (W_{hk})$. Initially, $T=W=0$. After every game,
for every $(h,k)$ (including for $h=k$), if players $h$ and $k$ tied (that is, both won or both lost),
the entry $T_{hk}$ is increased by 1, while if player $h$ won and player $k$ lost, the
entry $W_{hk}$ is increased by 1 and $W_{kh}$ is decreased by 1.

Prove that at the end of the tournament, $\det(T+iW)$ is a non-negative integer divisible by $2^{2010}$.

\item[B5]
Let $a_1, a_2, \dots$ be real numbers. Suppose that there is a constant $A$ such that for all $n$,
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{1 + (x-a_i)^2} \right)^2\,dx \leq An.
\]
Prove there is a constant $B>0$ such that for all $n$,
\[
\sum_{i,j=1}^n (1 + (a_i - a_j)^2) \geq Bn^3.
\]
 
\item[B6]
Let $p$ be an odd prime. Show that for at least $(p+1)/2$ values of $n$ in $\{0,1,2,\dots,p-1\}$,
$\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} k! n^k$
is not divisible by $p$.
